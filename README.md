# It Takes Two (Advance)
A port/demake of It Takes Two for the Game Boy Advance. No, seriously.

# Overview

The gameplay of It Takes Two isn't exactly taxing, making it a perfect fit for the newest Nintendo console - the Gameboy Advance! This backport/demake will incorporate most of the gameplay of It Takes Two in a smaller form factor. Maybe I'll even fix the recipes.

# Software
